# DMArcadeInterface
This is the source code for the user interface for the Digital Media arcade machine at WCTA in Las Vegas NV.  
It was written in Visual Studio 2013, on a computer running Windows 7.
Any later versions of Visual Studio or Windows should work, but earlier versions probably won't.
Direct X was used for rendering 3D graphics and everything else was written in C++.
